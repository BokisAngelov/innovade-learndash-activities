== Description ==

LearnDash is an exceptional learning management system (LMS) that enables you to manage online courses effectively. However, if you're looking to enhance your course's engagement and interactivity, you might need to consider adding more topic types and tweaking the completion process.

With Innovade Learndash Activities, you can elevate your course content by incorporating four new topic types, each with its unique features. The first is the downloadable file topic, which allows users to upload any document format, such as PDF, Word, or PPT. Second, you can add an external link topic, enabling learners to access relevant websites directly from your course. Third, the Youtube video topic allows you to embed videos from Youtube by copying and pasting the URL into the iframe. Lastly, the plain text topic allows you to create engaging content to enrich your course.

Moreover, Innovade Learndash Activities introduces two types of completion criteria that you can choose from, depending on your preferences. The first is the default LearnDash mark as complete process. The second is the on-click complete process, available for downloadable files and external links. By clicking on these topics, the system automatically marks them as completed.

In summary, Innovade Learndash Activities expands your course's possibilities and flexibility by introducing new topic types and alternative completion processes.
